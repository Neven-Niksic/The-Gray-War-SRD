# The Gray War SRD
This is the SRD for The Gray War, a WW2-era zombie RPG I originally published on one of the 24-hour RPG threads on 4chan's /tg/ board. The only major difference between this release and that original version is rephrasing of certain things and the fact it's released under a different author name.

## Story
In 1940, when Germany, Italy, and the Allies started to clash in Africa, a comet fell somewhere in Libya. Although the comet was initially seized by Italians, it was handed over to Germany, whose scientists started studying it.

It was quickly revealed that the comet contained a previously-unknown bacteria that, once located inside a human body, causes a flesh decay similar to gangrene and changes to behaviour. A victim becomes either lethargic or aggresive, and in latter case may develop cannibalistic tendencies as well.

Effectively, the victim becomes similar to modern depiction of zombies in fiction, albeit still alive, at least until they truly die due to hunger, dehydration, getting killed by someone else, or sheer body damage brought on by the bacteria. When a victim dies, it stays dead and unmoving, and does not magically become a walking corpse.

Nazis initially controlled the bacteria so it doesn't spread out of their laboratories and start a massive outbreak. However, it somehow managed to get out and initiate a rampage, with both civilians and soldiers getting infected. In continental Europe, the epicenter is in Germany, with the disease starting to spread out into other countries as well. In Africa, it's centered in Lybia where the bacteria-filled comet was originally retrieved, but it seems that the disease is having more difficulties spreading there, maybe because of Africa's higher temperatures.

Characters can be anyone who can reasonably exist during the Second World War in a country related to it. Maybe they're frontline soldiers, scientists, politicans, or civilians, all whose lives now got even harder thanks to this new disease that appeared, in addition to war itself.
