When a character tries to do something where the success is not guaranteed, he
needs to make an action roll (AR). AR is made by rolling an amount of dice
equal to his attribute + skill. If there's no appropriate skill, attribute is
used alone.
All dice that roll 8 or higher are counted as a success, with 10s counting as
two successes. If a character rolls all 1s, he has made a botched roll,
triggering a truly bad outcome.

UNCONTESTED ROLLS
In situations when a character is not opposed by someone else, the amount of
successes is compared to the difficulty number (DN). If the player rolled an
amount of successes that's equal to or greater than the DN, he has succeeded at
the action.

CONTESTED ROLLS
In situations when a character is opposed, both sides make a separate AR. As
appropriate, the attribute + skill can be the same or different.
The side that rolls more successes is considered the winner.

DIFFUCULTY NUMBER
DN represent how difficult a task is and it's determined by the GM on the basis
of how difficult something should be to accomplish.
- easy – DN 1
- medium – DN 3
- difficult – DN 5
- very difficult – DN 7
- impossible – DN 9
Some situations can modify the DN. However, it can never be lower than 1.
