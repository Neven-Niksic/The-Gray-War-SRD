All characters are defined by their level and experience (XP), health (HP),
attributes, skills, and owned items. Players can also choose their characters'
name and gender.

ATTRIBUTES
Characters have five attributes:
- Strength (STR) – character's ability to apply brute force
- Endurance (END) – character's resistance to damage, poisons, diseases, and
other similar occurrences
- Agility (AGI) – character's ability to move fast and use finer precise
movements
- Charisma (CHA) – character's ability to influence others
- Willpower (WIL) – character's resistance to influence by others and other
psychological challenges
- Perception (PER) – character's ability to find and see things around him
- Luck (LUC) – a measure of how often random events go in character's favor
Attributes range from 1 to 7 and start at 3, the human average. During
character creation, a player can choose to lower one attribute to increase
another one on the 1-to-1 basis. An attribute cannot be lowered below 1 in this
way.

LEVEL AND XP
Characters start at level 1 and can reach the maximum of level 5. The following
table shows how many XP a character needs to gather in order to level up.
 ___________________

A character should receive 3 XP per session for an average performance. This
amount can be increased if a character performed very well or a lot, or
decreased if he performed badly or not often. On average, this lets a character
reach the maximum level at the end of 11th session.
When a character levels up, he receives 5 advancement points (AP). 1 AP can be
used to increase a skill by 1, while 2 AP can be used to increase an attribute
by 1.
There's no limit to how high a skill can be increased in this matter, while
attributes have an upper limit of 7.
During character creation (level 1), a character has access to 5 AP that can be
used on skills only.
All AP have to be spent immediately – they can't be saved for later.

HEALTH
Character's maximum HP is equal to (END + level) x 3, and it increases by an
additional +2 on every level up. Should a character's END change, recalcute his
HP.
Characters who drop to 0 HP start bleeding out and are rendered unconcious,
losing 1 HP per turn at the moment of their initiative. If they're not
stabilized with a medical kit before their HP drops to -4, they die. If they're
stabilized but their HP is still lower than 1, it becomes 1.
Without help, stabilized characters heal 1d10 + (END / 2) per week.

SKILLS
Skills start at 0. There is no upper limit to how high they can be raised.
If more than one skill can be used in a given situation, either the player will
choose which one to use or the GM will tell him so.
The complete list of skills can be found in the skills section.
